Sakankom is an app that facilitates housing reservations and furniture purchases. 
Users of the Sakancom application fall into three categories: Tenants who can see 
all flats and reserve one They can also create orders, remove them, see their 
details, and generate a bill for them. Apartment owners have the option to add an 
apartment to a reservation with its data (capacity, location, and brief description), 
delete it, or display both the available and reserved units. and Administrators who 
have the ability to add new sellable things by providing all necessary information 
(name, kind, quantity), remove them, display all orders placed with the company, 
view unpaid orders, and search for users and objects.
